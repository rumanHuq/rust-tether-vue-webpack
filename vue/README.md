# Yet-Another-Vue-Webpack-Boilerplate

## Webpack 4 + Babel 7 + typescript(with babel loaderðŸ™€) + Eslint(works withing .ts file) + SASS + PostCSS and many more to come over time

This has become my guilty pleasure. I love playing with webpack. I didnot want to make only typescript specific configuration. Babel 7 has made it possible to integrate typescript smoothly.

```bash
npm start
npm run prod
```
